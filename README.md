### What I learned

In this challenge I learned more about the mix-blend-mode property.

```css
img {
  img {
  opacity: .8;
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}

.hero-img {
  border-radius: 0.6rem 0.6rem 0 0;
  background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
}

```
### Useful resources

  - [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode)
  - [Kevin Powell - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAA89nkEuhw) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand the differences between the modes aswell as the issues that can come up when using mix-blend-mode with text. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
